# Purpose of the Project :

The aim of this project is to build a full-stack website that allows users to suggest and fund projects from me. It is intended to have a list of items that are suggested by users but must first must be approved by an admin before they are public and possible to be funded. Once a project is funded, the user who funded the project will recieve updates on the project. All projects can be commented on by users
